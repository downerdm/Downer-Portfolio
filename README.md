# Downer-Portfolio

## Your Task

A portfolio of work to showcase skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. It should meet all critical requirements necessary to satisfy a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs.  It should highlight my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it.

The following acceptance criteria was as follows:

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
## Page Structure & Attributes

It has a classic, elegant color scheme so that the pictures and icons on the page draw all of the attention.

The page consists of 4 primary sections:
  * A header with a photo and navbar
  * A footer with contact links
  * A section which serves as a mini-resume
  * A section which highlights my work so far
  
Semantic html was used throughout allowing for better accessibility.  All images have ALT tags.

The section with icons of and links to my projects incorporates responsive design, allowing the page to reassemble itself on smaller viewports.  Since I have not done that many projects, I used the last space as a holder for what comes next.

At W3Schools I learned how to (and took the code to) incorporate social media icons in the contact section.
